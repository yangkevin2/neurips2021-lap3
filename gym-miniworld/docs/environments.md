# List of MiniWorld Environments

For details about the observations and action space, consult the
[MiniWorld Design](/docs/design.md) document.

# Hallway

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-Hallway-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/hallway_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

In this environment, the agent has to go to a red box at the end of a
straight hallway. Requires the agent to walk forward and correct its course
to avoid bumping into walls. Think of this environment as a kind of "Hello World!".
It is easily solved with reinforcement learning and is useful for debugging purposes,
to verify that your training code is working correctly.

# OneRoom

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-OneRoom-v0`
- `MiniWorld-OneRoomS6-v0`
- `MiniWorld-OneRoomS6Fast-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/oneroom_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

One single large room in which the agent has to navigate to a red box.
Requires the agent to turn around and scan the room to find the red
box.

# T-Maze

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-TMaze-v0`
- `MiniWorld-TMazeLeft-v0`
- `MiniWorld-TMazeRight-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/tmaze_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

In this environment, there is a T-junction. The agent has to get to the
junction point, and turn either left or right to reach a red box, which
is randomly placed at one end or the other. The environment comes in three
variants. In the default variant, the red box is randomly placed in the left
or right arm of the maze in each episode. In the `MiniWorld-TMazeLeft-v0`
variant, the box is always in the left arm, and in the `MiniWorld-TMazeRight-v0`
variant, the box is always in the right arm. This can be used to experiment
with transfer learning.

# Y-Maze

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-YMaze-v0`
- `MiniWorld-YMazeLeft-v0`
- `MiniWorld-YMazeRight-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/ymaze_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

Similar to the T-Maze environment, but with a Y-shaped junction instead of
a T-shaped junction. This environment can be used to test skill transfer
between it and the T-Maze environment.

# Maze

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-Maze-v0`
- `MiniWorld-MazeS3-v0`
- `MiniWorld-MazeS3Fast-v0`
- `MiniWorld-MazeS2-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/maze_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

Navigate to a goal through a procedurally generated maze. The largest version of this environment (`MiniWorld-Maze-v0`) is extremely hard to solve as it has a sparse reward and a long time horizon. The `MazeS3Fast` environment has faster movement actions (bigger time steps) making it easier to solve than the regular `MazeS3`.

# FourRooms

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-FourRooms-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/fourrooms_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

Inspired by the classic four-rooms gridworld environment. The agent appears
at a random position inside 4 rooms connected by 4 openings. In order to
get a reward, the agent must reach a red box.

# Sidewalk

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-Sidewalk-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/sidewalk_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

The agent must walk to an object at the end of the sidewalk, while avoiding
walking into the street. Reaching the object provides a positive reward,
but walking into the street terminates the episode with zero reward.

# PickupObjs

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-PickupObjs-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/pickupobjs_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

One single large room in which the agent has to collect several objects. The
agent gets +1 reward for collecting each object. The episode terminates when
all objects are collected or when the time step limit is exceeded.

# CollectHealth

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-CollectHealth-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/collecthealth_0.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

Inspired by VizDoom's HealthGathering environment. The agent is placed inside
a room filled with acid and has to collect medkits in order to survive. The
reward corresponds to the survival time of the agent. Please note that the
rewards produced in this environment are not directly comparable to VizDoom's
as the dynamics are not exactly the same.

# PutNext

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-PutNext-v0`

There are multiple colored boxes of random sizes in one large room. In order
to get a reward, the agent must put the red box next to the yellow box.

# RemoteBot

Registered configurations:
- `MiniWorld-RemoteBot-v0`

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/minibot.jpg" width=300></img>
</p>

This is a fake environment that uses ZMQ to connect remotely to a small robot (MiniBot). The robot uses differential drive and discrete actions that match those of MiniWorld. This makes it possible to do sim-to-real transfer experiments. Note that domain randomization needs to be enabled to make this work. This [repository](https://github.com/maximecb/minibot-iface) contains the code that runs on the robot and interfaces with the `RemoteBot` environment.
